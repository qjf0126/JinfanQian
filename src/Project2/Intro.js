          I have been using Steam to discover and purchase games for 6 years and have its mobile app on my phone ever since. However, I've never opened it except for authentication. By browsing the Google Play reviews, many people might share the same experience â€” the app is a clumsy replica of the desktop version. It's hard to use and bring no additional values to gamers.

          On the other hand, over 70% of games on the Steam platform are indie games, most of which desperately needs to reach their audience. With people spending more and more time on their phone, these downloaded but dormant Steam apps living in every gamer's phone is such a waste of opportunities for game developers and Steam.

          ðŸ’¡ How might we re-design the Steam Mobile app to be useful and usable for gamers and valuable for game developers?
