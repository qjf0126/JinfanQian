          What if <em>interactions</em> were always familiar,<br />
          like your daily walk to the corner store.<br />
          What if <em>products</em> were not just tools,<br />
          but a good friend who comes forward<br />
          and takes your hand.<br />
          What if <em>data</em> were not just numbers,<br />
          but also colors, stories,<br />
          and deep blue eyes,<br />
          that stare into your soul.
        </p>
        <p>I often dream of this world.</p>
